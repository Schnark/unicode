explain-fonts.innerHTML = You probably don't have fonts for all Unicode characters. So this page allows you to load various free fonts from the web and use them. They are grouped together in several groups, note that some of these can be quite large, so make sure you have good internet connection before enabling them. Once you loaded fonts from this list, you can toggle them on and off via the icon in the top right corner of most pages. Most of these fonts come from Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noto family</a>, the only two exceptions are TwitterColorEmoji, designed by <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twemoji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> and converted into a TTF by <a href="https://github.com/eosrei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brad Erickson</a>, and Symbola by <a href="http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Douros</a>. They are delivered by <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cdn.rawgit.com</a>.
